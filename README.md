# Tanasorn Chindasook Advanced Project 1

Shiny dashboard created in R for Advanced Project 1 at Jacobs University, Bremen under the supervision of Professor Adalbert Wilhelm. 

The data files uploaded are dummy data that has been altered in order to hide the client's identity.

The Exchange Rate Crawler folder contains the code used to crawl xe.com for exchange rate information for data enrichment.

Other code used for data cleansing has not (yet) been uploaded due to revealing information about the client's identity.

Certain visualisations included in the dashboard have been inspired by the following:
